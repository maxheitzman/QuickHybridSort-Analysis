# QuickHybridSort Analysis

This project analyzes a hybrid sorting algorithm that switches between QuickSort and Insertion Sort based on a threshold `k`.

## 🧠 Overview
- Written in Python
- Evaluates performance crossover point for hybrid sorting
- Visualizes runtime comparisons across different input sizes

## 📁 Files
- `qhs.py`: main program that runs the hybrid sort analysis
- Any other plots or data files go here...

## 📊 Output
Generates timing graphs that show when hybrid sort outperforms pure QuickSort or Insertion Sort.

## 📌 Concepts Used
- QuickSort
- Insertion Sort
- Hybrid algorithm design
- Empirical runtime analysis
- Matplotlib plotting

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
python qhs.py
