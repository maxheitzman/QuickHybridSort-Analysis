# QuickHybridSort Analysis

This project analyzes the performance crossover point between QuickSort and InsertionSort.  
Written in Python as part of a CS algorithms course project at Texas Tech University.

## Features

- Implements a hybrid sort (QuickSort + InsertionSort)
- Tests various threshold values for switching algorithms
- Measures and plots runtime crossover behavior
- Includes both sorted and randomized input testing

## Files

- `qhs.py`: Main script with hybrid sort implementation and timing logic
- Plots saved as images or displayed via `matplotlib`
